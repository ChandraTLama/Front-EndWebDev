  <h1>Neuronal Culture and Treatments</h1>
  <div>
	<p>RCN (rat cortical neurons) were cultured as  described in zheng et al., 2001b. 
	Study was then focused on the influence of BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), gp120 and glutamate. 
	</p>
	<p>
	RCN was treated with BDNF for 2-6 days, also with gp120 or glutamate for 2-6 days using different doses/concentrations. 
	Then effect is assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). For data mining, data were collected from high concentration treatments.
